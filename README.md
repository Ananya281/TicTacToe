# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. The grid consists of nine cells where players take turns marking their symbol (usually X and O) in an attempt to create a line of three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

Here's a step-by-step gameplay overview:

The game begins with an empty 3x3 grid.
Player 1, usually assigned X, takes the first turn.
Player 1 marks an empty cell with their symbol (X) on the grid.
Player 2, assigned O, takes the second turn and marks an empty cell with their symbol.
Players alternate turns until either one player wins or the game ends in a tie.
A win occurs when one player successfully places three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal on the grid.
If a win condition is met, the game ends, and the winning player is declared.
If all cells are filled and no win condition is met, the game ends in a tie.
The players have the option to start a new game and repeat the process.

Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple yet strategic game that requires players to plan their moves and anticipate their opponent's moves to secure a win. It's a popular game that can be played on paper, a physical game board, or even through digital implementations.
